# VisionARy
Often times figuring out which glasses you like isn't that convenient. Going to the store may take too much time or they may not have the glasses that you like. <br>
With VisionARy you can try on glasses of your preference
at your own comfort. Alternatively, you can try on some cool and funky glasses with friends to create funny pictures worthy of a picture book. Developed using HaarCascades and OpenCV, VisionARy was built for convenience and to make better eyesight more
accessible. With specially tailored glasses recommended by your preferences, VisionARy delivers you the
glasses that you want for the vision you need.
